### Hardware
In this project a Raspberry Pi3 B+ and a Raspberry Camera V2 are used.

### Introduction to Code
HSV code of stud is adjusted. So, contour function can detect easily the stud. If you want to detect any object via its colour, you should just learn the HSV code of your object and give it to the function.
Here is the SS of the program which is running on Raspberry Pi3 B+.
